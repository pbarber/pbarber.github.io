I use this site to archive posts from my old company website at [codeandnumbers.co.uk](codeandnumbers/README.md). Reading them now is a bit like reading my teenage poetry, if I had written any, both highly embarrassing and strangely comforting. The posts, newest first, are:

* [Asking the right questions](codeandnumbers/asking-the-right-questions.md)
* [How to present data for visualisation](codeandnumbers/how-to-present-data-for-visualisation.md)
* [COVID-19, waiting lists and NI hospital beds](codeandnumbers/covid-19-waiting-lists-and-ni-hospital-beds.md)
* [Improving trust in COVID-19 modelling](codeandnumbers/improving-trust-in-covid-19-modelling.md)
* [Data dynamics and COVID-19](codeandnumbers/data-dynamics-and-covid-19.md)
